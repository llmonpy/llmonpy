I need to name an exciting new technique for responding to requests that are given to LLMs to respond to.  
It is well known LLMs give better responses when shown given examples of good responses.  I have created a 
way to give LLMs an example of a good answer for the exact request they are responding too.  Given a 
request, I ask 4 different LLMs to respond.  Then I use another set of LLMs to judge and rank the responses.
The winning response is determined by majority vote of the LLM judges.  Then there is another round of response
generation, but the winner of the last round is given as example of a good response. 
Then the judges are used again to compare the winner of the first round against the winner of the 2nd round.
If the 2nd round wins, the cycle is repeated but with the winner of 
the 2nd round as the example of a good response. This continues as long as the responses keep getting better.

Some examples of good names for other algorithms are:

1. "Genetic Algorithms": simulate the process of evolution to solve optimization problems
2. "Quicksort": a sorting algorithm that is not the fastest but is very fast in practice.
3. "Ant Colony Optimization": Inspired by the foraging behavior of ants, this algorithm is used for solving 
    combinatorial optimization problems. Ants deposit pheromones to mark paths, which influences the 
    behavior of other ants, leading to optimal solutions over time.
4. YOLO (You Only Look Once): A real-time object detection algorithm that processes images in a single pass 
    through the network, making it faster and more efficient. The catchy name emphasizes the algorithm's 
    efficiency and speed.
5. PageRank: Developed by Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, this algorithm ranks web pages in 
    search engine results. The name is a play on Larry Page's name and the idea of ranking pages.
	
Some examples of good names for this process:

 2. "Refinement Cycle"
 3. "Iterative Excellence Tuning"
