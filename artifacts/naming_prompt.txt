You are a genius as generating names that are descriptive, but punchy and positive.  The names you generate don't sound
too technical or boring.

I need to name an exciting new technique for responding to requests that are given to LLMs to respond to.  It is well
known LLMs give better responses when shown given examples of good responses.  I have created a way to give LLMs an
example of a good answer for the exact request they are responding too.  Given a request, I ask 4 different LLMs to
respond.  Then I use another set of LLMs to judge and rank the responses.  The winning response is determined by
majority vote of the LLM judges.  Then there is another round of the tournament to generate a response, but the winner
of the last round is given as example of a good response.  I've found that this makes the 2nd round responses much,
much better!  The same LLMs as judge is used to pick a winner of the 2nd round.  Then the judges are used again to
compare the winner of the first round against the winner of the 2nd round.  If the 2nd round wins, the cycle is
repeated but with the winner of the 2nd round as the example of a good response. This continues as long as the
responses keep getting better.

I've found that creating the right name matters a lot.  For example, there was a process to compare 2 or more approaches
of responding to an LLM requests.  I called it an "Exploratory Trial".  No one paid any attention to the idea.  Then I
changed the name to "Battle".  Suddenly, everyone thought it was a great idea!  Other examples of good names for
algorith

The name I have right now is "Iterative Refinement Tournament".  Descriptive, but very boring.  Do you better ideas?
