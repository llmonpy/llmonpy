# LLMonPy

LLMonPy is a python library that aims to make it easy to build AI systems that generate "good enough" responses 99.9% 
of the time. LLMonPy makes it easy to use multiple language models (LLMs) to generate responses to prompts, to rank the
responses, and to use the best responses as examples to improve the quality of future responses.  It also generates 
question/best answer/worse answer (QBaWa) data that can be used for training models.
