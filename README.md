# LLMonPy

LLMonPy is a python library that aims to make it easy to build AI systems that generate "good enough" responses 99.9% of the time. 
It is still in the early stages of development, but you can check out src/samples
to see how it can be used.  

Sorry there isn't more documentation yet -- I am still fleshing out the core capabilities. Check out the src/samples 
directory to see how it can be used.  I am updating the repo several times a week now, so it should improve quickly.
