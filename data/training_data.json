I have created a \n            way to give LLMs an example of a good answer for the exact request they are responding too.  Given a \n            request, I ask a large group of different LLMs to respond.  Then I use another set of LLMs to judge and \n            rank the responses. The winning response is determined by majority vote of the LLM judges.  Then there is \n            another round of the tournament to generate a response, but the best results of the last round are given as \n            example of good responses. The 2nd round responses are much, much better!  The same LLMs as judge is used to\n            pick a winner of the 2nd round.  Then the judges are used again to compare the winner of the first round \n            against the winner of the 2nd round.  If the 2nd round wins, the cycle is repeated but with the winner of \n            the 2nd round as the example of a good response.
